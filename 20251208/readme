# Venv
VENV are project specific files we have global env and venv 
global env is used for gewneric tasks and you would see something like 
' PS C:\Users\ShivaGanesna\OneDrive - Accordion Partners\Desktop\VSCode> '
But when you use venv you would see something like (.venv) at the starting
 
python -m venv .venv
“Create a virtual environment in a folder named .venv inside the current directory.”


.\.venv\Scripts\activate
. at the starts specifies the path of current folder and activates the venv 
inside the .venv folder of the current folder

Even to create kernals we need to use python -m ipykernel install --user --name=20251208-env --display-name="Python (20251208-env)" 

Also craete seperate kernals for seperate folders

# chatbot
Ollama - 3 Line Explanation
Ollama lets you run AI chatbots (like ChatGPT) on your own laptop instead of using the internet.
It's completely free and private - your conversations stay on your computer.
Think of it like downloading a movie to watch offline, instead of streaming from Netflix.

How Ollama Works - 3 Lines
You download an AI model file (like downloading an app) to your computer.
Ollama runs that model using your laptop's processor/graphics card to generate responses.
You type questions, it processes them locally, and gives you answers - all without internet.

Why You Need Ollama - 5 Lines
Running AI models directly requires downloading huge files (50GB+), installing complex software, and writing code.
Your laptop would run out of memory and it would be extremely slow.
Ollama compresses the models to 1/4 size, handles all the technical setup automatically, and optimizes for your hardware.
It's like using VLC to play a movie instead of manually decoding video files with code.
Without Ollama, you'd spend days setting up what Ollama does in 2 commands.
