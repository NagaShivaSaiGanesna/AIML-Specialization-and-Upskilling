In **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Competitive Programming (CP)**, **Lambda functions** (also known as "Anonymous Functions") are used to write short, one-line functions without giving them a formal name.

They are most powerful when used as arguments inside higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sort()`.

## ⚡ Lambda Function Syntax

A lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only have **one expression**.

```python
# Syntax
lambda arguments : expression

```

### 1. The Basic Example

```python
# Regular Function
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Lambda Version
square_lambda = lambda x : x ** 2

print(square_lambda(5)) # Output: 25

```

## 🛠️ Essential Use Cases

### A. Sorting with Lambda (Crucial for CP)

In CP, you often need to sort a list of tuples or objects based on a specific property. The `key` parameter in `.sort()` is where lambdas shine.

```python
# List of (Student Name, Score)
data = [("Alice", 88), ("Bob", 95), ("Charlie", 82)]

# Sort by Score (index 1) instead of Name
data.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
# Result: [('Charlie', 82), ('Alice', 88), ('Bob', 95)]

```

### B. Filtering Data (ML Preprocessing)

When cleaning data, you might want to filter out rows or values that don't meet a specific threshold.

```python
prices = [100, 250, 50, 500, 10]

# Keep only prices higher than 100
expensive_stuff = list(filter(lambda x: x > 100, prices))
# Result: [250, 500]

```

### C. Mapping Transformations

Use `map()` to apply a function to every element in an iterable. This is a "vectorized" way of thinking similar to NumPy.

```python
# Normalize data (Scale by dividing by 10)
raw_data = [10, 20, 30, 40]
scaled_data = list(map(lambda x: x / 10, raw_data))
# Result: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

```

## 📊 Summary Table: Lambda vs. Regular Function

| Feature | Lambda Function | Regular Function (`def`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | Anonymous (No name) | Named |
| **Length** | Single line only | Multiple lines allowed |
| **Return** | Implicitly returns the result | Requires `return` keyword |
| **Use Case** | Quick, throwaway tasks | Complex, reusable logic |

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

1. **Readability:** Overusing lambdas can make your code hard to read. If the logic is complex, use `def`.
2. **Debugging:** Since they are anonymous, traceback errors for lambdas can be harder to interpret.
3. **No Statements:** You cannot use `pass`, `assert`, or `raise` inside a lambda.

## 💡 Pro-Tip: Conditional Lambda

You can even use `if-else` inside a lambda to perform simple logic during data transformation.

```python
# Binary Classifier Labeling
# If score >= 0.5, label 1, else 0
get_label = lambda x: 1 if x >= 0.5 else 0

print(get_label(0.7)) # Output: 1
print(get_label(0.3)) # Output: 0

```
