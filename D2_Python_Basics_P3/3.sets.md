## 🛠️ Sets: The High-Speed Data Filter

In **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Competitive Programming (CP)**, **Sets** are your secret weapon for deduplication and rapid searching. A Set is an unordered collection of **unique** elements.

Because sets are built on **Hash Tables**, searching for an item takes **O(1)** time on average, whereas searching a list takes **O(n)**.

### 1. Definition and Syntax

Sets use curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.

> **Important:** `set()` creates an empty set. `{}` creates an empty dictionary.

```python
# ML Use Case: Finding unique class labels
labels = ['cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'dog']
unique_labels = set(labels) 
# Output: {'cat', 'dog', 'bird'}

# CP Use Case: Tracking visited nodes in a graph
visited = set()
visited.add((0, 1)) # We add tuples because they are hashable

```

### 2. High-Speed Mathematical Operations

These operations are essential for comparing datasets, such as checking for feature overlap between training and testing data.

| Operation | Syntax | Method | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Union** | `a \| b` | `a.union(b)` | Find union of elements/features.
| **Intersection** | `a & b` | `a.intersection(b)` | Find common elements/features. |
| **Difference** | `a - b` | `a.difference(b)` | Find elements in `a` but NOT in `b`. |
| **Symmetric Diff** | `a ^ b` | `a.symmetric_difference(b)` | Find elements unique to each set. |

---

### 3. Essential Set Methods

* **`.add(value)`**: Inserts an element. (**O(1)**)
* **`.remove(value)`**: Removes an element; crashes if the value isn't there.
* **`.discard(value)`**: Removes an element; **does not** crash if it's missing (safer for CP).
* **`.pop()`**: Removes and returns an *arbitrary* element.

### 4. Comparison Table: Set vs. List

| Feature | Set `{}` | List `[]` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Search Speed** | **O(1)** (Instant) | **O(n)** (Linear scan) |
| **Ordering** | Unordered | Ordered (Maintains index) |
| **Duplicates** | Not allowed | Allowed |
| **Use Case** | Membership tests, Deduplication | Storing sequences, Stacks, Queues |

### 5. Set Comprehensions

You can clean and transform data in a single line while automatically removing duplicates.

```python
# Create a set of squared values for even numbers only
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
even_squares = {x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0}
# Result: {4, 16}

```

### 💡 Pro-Tip: The "Membership" Performance Hack

If you are doing millions of lookups (`if item in collection`), always convert your `list` to a `set` first. It can reduce your runtime from minutes to seconds in CP.

```python
# SLOW: O(n) search
if item in large_list: 
    pass

# FAST: O(1) search
large_set = set(large_list)
if item in large_set:
    pass

```
