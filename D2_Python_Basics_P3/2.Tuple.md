Tuples are often overlooked, but in **Machine Learning (ML)**, they are the standard for "fixed" structures like input shapes, hyperparameter pairs, and data dimensions. In **Competitive Programming (CP)**, they are perfect for storing coordinates or weighted edges in a graph.

The key thing to remember: **Tuples are Immutable**. Once created, they cannot be changed.

## 🛠️ Tuple Essentials

### 1. Definition and Syntax

Tuples use parentheses `()`.

> **Note:** To create a tuple with a single element, you **must** include a trailing comma: `single_tup = (5,)`. Without the comma, Python sees it as a simple integer in parentheses.

```python
# ML Example: Defining image dimensions
input_shape = (224, 224, 3) 

# CP Example: Weighted graph edge (u, v, weight)
edge = (1, 2, 10)

```

### 2. Why use Tuples over Lists?

1. **Safety:** In ML, passing an `input_shape` as a tuple ensures no part of your code accidentally changes the dimensions.
2. **Performance:** Tuples are slightly faster and more memory-efficient than lists.
3. **Hashability (Dictionary Keys):** Unlike lists, tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary.
```python
# Using a coordinate tuple as a key (Common in CP)
visited_cells = {}
visited_cells[(0, 1)] = True

```

### 3. Tuple Unpacking (The ML Favorite)

This is the most frequent way you will interact with tuples. Most ML libraries (like PyTorch or Scikit-Learn) return data in tuples.

```python
# ML Use Case: Splitting data
# train_test_split returns a tuple of 4 elements
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = (data_a, data_b, labels_a, labels_b)

# CP Use Case: Swapping variables without a 'temp' variable
a, b = 10, 20
a, b = b, a  # Swaps values using implicit tuple packing/unpacking

```

### 4. Important Methods

Since tuples are immutable, they only have two methods:

* **`.count(value)`**: Returns the number of times a value occurs.
* **`.index(value)`**: Returns the first index of the value.

### 5. Summary Table: Tuples vs. Lists

| Feature | Tuple `()` | List `[]` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mutability** | Immutable (Fixed) | Mutable (Changeable) |
| **Size** | Fixed | Dynamic |
| **Performance** | Faster | Slower |
| **Methods** | `count`, `index` | `append`, `pop`, `sort`, etc. |
| **Use Case** | Constants, Shapes, Dictionary Keys | Data collections, Stacks, Queues |

### 💡 Pro-Tip: The "Packing" Trap

If you return multiple values from a Python function, you are actually returning a single **tuple**.

```python
def get_stats(arr):
    return min(arr), max(arr) # This returns a tuple

result = get_stats([1, 2, 3])
print(type(result)) # <class 'tuple'>

```
