## 🚀 PowerShell Predictive IntelliSense Setup

Use these steps to enable the "Ghost Text" and **ListView** command suggestions in your PowerShell terminal. This module tracks your command history and provides interactive suggestions as you type.

### 📋 Installation Commands

Run these commands in a PowerShell window. **Note:** Steps 1 and 4 require **Administrator** privileges.

```powershell
# 1. Install the PSReadLine module (prerelease version for latest features)
Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Force

# 2. Create the PowerShell Profile file if it does not already exist
if (!(Test-Path $PROFILE)) { New-Item -Type File -Path $PROFILE -Force }

# 3. Append the configuration to your permanent profile script
@'
Import-Module PSReadLine
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView
'@ | Out-File -FilePath $PROFILE -Append

# 4. Update Execution Policy to allow the profile script to run automatically
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine -Force

# 5. Reload the profile to apply changes to the current session
. $PROFILE

```

### 💡 Key Features Enabled

* **PredictionSource History**: Suggests commands based on what you have successfully typed in the past.
* **ListView Style**: Displays suggestions in a vertical menu (navigable with arrow keys) rather than just inline text.
* **Persistence**: Because these are added to your `$PROFILE`, they will load every time you open a new terminal.

> [!TIP]
> Once the list appears, you can use the **Up/Down Arrow keys** to navigate the suggestions and **Right Arrow** or **Tab** to accept a selection.
