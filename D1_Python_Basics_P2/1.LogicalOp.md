The result of `print(not 2 and not 3)` is **`False`**.


#### 1. Truthiness (What is "True"?)

In Python, every object has an inherent boolean value.

* **Any non-zero number** (like `2` or `3`) is considered **`True`**.
* The number `0` is considered **`False`**.

#### 2. The `not` Operator

The `not` operator flips the boolean value.

* `not 2` becomes **`False`** (because 2 is True).
* `not 3` becomes **`False`** (because 3 is True).


### The Order of Operations (Precedence)

Python doesn't just read left-to-right; it follows a specific order:

1. **`not`** has higher priority. It is evaluated first.
2. **`and`** is evaluated next.
3. **`or`** is evaluated last.

### Interesting Comparisons

Look at how changing the numbers or the operators changes the outcome:

| Expression | Logic | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `not 0` | `not False` | `True` |
| `not 2 and 3` | `False and 3` | `False` |
| `2 and 3` | Both are True | `3` (Python returns the last True value) |
| `0 or 5` | First is False, check second | `5` |

**Pro-Tip:** In Python, `and` and `or` don't always return `True` or `False`. They return the **actual value** of the object that decided the outcome! For example, `2 and 3` returns `3`.
