The if __name__ == "__main__": guard identifies if a file is being used as the leader or just a helper. When you run a script directly, Python labels it "__main__", triggering the code inside the guard to run. If you import that same file into a new project, Python gives it a different label, causing it to skip the guarded code. This prevents "helper" files from accidentally running their own tests or input prompts when you only wanted to use their functions. It is the standard way to keep your code organized, reusable, and professional.

`When i ran the query by impoerting the get_factorial function the guard skipped the main() execution`

To see how this works in real-time, you can add a simple print statement to any script. It helps you visualize which "mode" Python is in: either **direct execution** or **module import**.

### Try This Experiment

Create a file named `identity_check.py` and paste this code:

```python
print(f"The value of __name__ is currently: '{__name__}'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Logic inside the guard: I am the MAIN file being run!")
else:
    print("Logic outside the guard: I have been IMPORTED as a module!")

```

#### Scenario A: Run it directly

If you run `python identity_check.py` in your terminal, the output will be:

* `The value of __name__ is currently: '__main__'`
* `Logic inside the guard: I am the MAIN file being run!`

#### Scenario B: Import it

If you open a different Python file (or a Python shell) and type `import identity_check`, the output will be:

* `The value of __name__ is currently: 'identity_check'`
* `Logic outside the guard: I have been IMPORTED as a module!`

### Comparison Table: Direct vs. Imported

| Aspect | Running Directly (e.g., `python script.py`) | Importing (e.g., `import script`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`__name__` value** | Always set to `"__main__"` | Set to the filename (e.g., `"identity_check"`) |
| **The Guard** | The `if` condition is **True** | The `if` condition is **False** |
| **Use Case** | Running tests, CLI prompts, or main logic. | Sharing functions and classes with other files. |

### Summary in a Nutshell

* **`__name__`** is a built-in variable Python automatically creates.
* **`"__main__"`** is just the name Python gives to whichever script you started with your "Play" button.
