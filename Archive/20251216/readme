What is NLP:

# Definition:
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, a branch of AI that enables computers to understand and process human language.

# Core Purpose:
It bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding, making computers interact with text and speech naturally.

# Key Techniques: 
Uses machine learning, deep learning, and linguistic rules to analyze syntax, semantics, and context in language.

# Common Applications: 
Powers chatbots, voice assistants, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and search engines.

# Modern Approach: 
Leverages advanced models like transformers (BERT, GPT) to achieve human-like language understanding and generation.


# Core Terminology:
Corpus: A complete paragraph or collection of text
Documents/Sentences: Individual sentences within the corpus
Vocabulary: All unique words in the text (like a dictionary)
Words: Individual words/tokens in the corpus

Tokenization:
Definition: The process of breaking text into smaller units (tokens)
Two Types:

Paragraph → Sentences: Split by delimiters (periods, exclamation marks, etc.)
Sentences → Words: Break down into individual words

Example:

Text: "I like to drink apple juice. My friend likes mango juice."
Sentence tokens: 2 sentences
Word tokens: 11 total words
Vocabulary: 9-10 unique words (duplicates like "juice" counted once; "like" and "likes" are different)

Why It Matters:

Translation: It converts raw text into numerical values (vectors), which is the only format neural networks can process and mathematically understand.

Efficiency: It breaks complex sentences into manageable units (sub-words or characters), allowing models to handle vast vocabularies and unknown words efficiently.
