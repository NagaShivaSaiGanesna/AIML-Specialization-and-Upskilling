# HTML Integration in Flask

In professional web development, returning raw strings or hardcoded HTML tags from your Python code is not scalable. This guide explores how to integrate proper **HTML files** into your Flask application using the **Jinja2** template engine and the `render_template` function.

## 1. Returning Raw HTML vs. Template Files

While Flask allows you to return HTML tags directly as a string, it is considered a poor practice for anything beyond a simple test.

### The "Quick" Method (Not Recommended for Production)

You can wrap your return strings in HTML tags like `<h1>` or `<p>`.

```python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "<html><body><h1>Welcome to the Flask Course</h1></body></html>"

```

### The Professional Method: `render_template`

To keep your logic (Python) separate from your presentation (HTML), Flask provides the `render_template` function. This allows you to maintain clean, dedicated `.html` files.

---

## 2. The Templates Folder Structure

Flask follows a strict directory convention. To render an HTML file, you must place it in a folder named **`templates`** located in the same directory as your main application file.

**Project Directory Structure:**

```text
my_flask_app/
│
├── main.py             # Your Flask application code
├── templates/          # MUST be named exactly 'templates'
│   ├── index.html
│   └── about.html

```

---

## 3. Implementing `render_template`

To use external HTML files, follow these three steps:

### Step 1: Import the function

Add `render_template` to your Flask imports.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

```

### Step 2: Create the View Function

Use `render_template("filename.html")` in your return statement. Flask will automatically look inside the `/templates` folder for this file.

```python
@app.route("/index")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return render_template("about.html")

```

### Step 3: Create the HTML File

Inside `/templates/index.html`, you can write standard HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Flask App</h1>
    <p>This is a professional web application built with Flask.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

## 4. Troubleshooting: "Template Not Found"

If you receive a `TemplateNotFound` error, check the following:

* **Folder Name:** Ensure the folder is named `templates` (plural), not `template`.
* **File Extension:** Ensure your file ends in `.html`.
* **Pathing:** Ensure the `templates` folder is at the same level as your `main.py` script.

## 5. HTTP Verbs: Introduction to GET

By default, all routes you create in Flask respond to **GET** requests.

* **GET:** Used to request data from a specified resource (e.g., viewing a page).
* **POST:** Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource (e.g., submitting a form).

In upcoming sessions, we will explore how to explicitly define these methods to handle user data.

## Summary Comparison

| Feature | Direct String Return | `render_template` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Complexity** | Simple for 1-2 lines | Handles complex layouts |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Poor (Python & HTML mixed) | Excellent (Clean separation) |
| **Maintenance** | Difficult to update | Easy to edit via HTML files |
| **Best Use Case** | Debugging / Quick tests | Production-grade applications |
